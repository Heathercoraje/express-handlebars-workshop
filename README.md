# Express Handlebars.js code-along workshop

This is a workshop designed as a code along to learn about html templating using Handlebars.js.
The main objectives of the workshop are to:
- be introduced to the MVC (Model - View - Controller) model
- learn how to serve dynamic files using Handlebars.js templates
- learn how to use Handlebars views, layouts and partials
- be introduced to Handlebars helpers
- there is an additional readme ([mentors-notes.md](./mentors-notes.md)) that the mentor can use to explain the theory behind handlebars and follow step by step instructions for the code-along workshop.
